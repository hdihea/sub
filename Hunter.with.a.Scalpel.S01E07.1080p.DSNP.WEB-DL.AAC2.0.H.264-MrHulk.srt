From now on, write down the food or
the thing you want in this book.

I'll buy it for you later.

15
00:01:13,303 --> 00:01:15,906
But, you have to write
picture diary.

16
00:01:15,953 --> 00:01:17,455
What is a diary?

17
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:23,915
Write what you did on the day
that and happy or sad things like that.

Yoon Se-eun, why?
The background is all red?

22
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:51,485
Later the red color will run out.
Use other colors too.

23
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,955
Give. I have to
coloring this side too.

24
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,970
Does it have to be red?

25
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,494
What's this?

26
00:02:01,307 --> 00:02:02,140
The sea.

27
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,212
What?

28
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,126
Who is the person who colors the sea?
In red?

29
00:02:09,152 --> 00:02:09,985
Look.

30
00:02:10,102 --> 00:02:12,165
More like the sea than
wear red, right?

00:04:18,236 --> 00:04:19,308
I remember!

36
00:04:19,371 --> 00:04:21,720
No wonder I feel familiar
while paying attention to it.

37
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:25,780
Isn't this eye shape
similar to Doctor Seo?

38
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,625
You're such a jerk!

39
00:04:28,664 --> 00:04:32,332
Ignore the eye shape and center
That face is the nose, right?

40
00:04:32,357 --> 00:04:34,398
Her nose is very different.

41
00:04:34,445 --> 00:04:37,975
Why can't a criminal detective like you have
a talent for recognizing at first sight?

42
00:04:38,535 --> 00:04:40,986
For the time being, the selection
first we are...

43
00:04:41,019 --> 00:04:44,938
a woman in her 30s who lives in the city
Yongcheon and similar to this photo.

44
00:04:44,962 --> 00:04:47,896
So, we are looking for a child
the one that was lost first, right?

45
00:04:49,154 --> 00:04:49,987
Chairman Jung?

46
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,113
Yes.

47
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,833
We prioritize that
because this is a 2003 photo.

48
00:04:56,008 --> 00:04:57,225
Montage spread today?

49
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:00,530
Yes, the relief team went
and the old town area is finished.

50
00:05:00,555 --> 00:05:02,515
New city area team
will also be completed today.

51
00:05:02,643 --> 00:05:04,872
Let's just accept the montage report first.

52
00:05:05,003 --> 00:05:07,092
Who knows, we might get big results.

53
00:05:07,953 --> 00:05:08,786
Yes, come on.

54
00:05:09,961 --> 00:05:12,171
Are there no results yet from
yesterday's checkup?

55
00:05:12,246 --> 00:05:17,005
The relationship between victims
increasingly non-existent.

56
00:05:17,119 --> 00:05:19,873
There are no work
relations or acquaintances.

57
00:05:19,962 --> 00:05:23,842
The first and third victims
have the same financial records.

58
00:05:24,542 --> 00:05:25,375
In which part?

59
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,779
Min-guk's laundry.

60
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:30,014
Seok-woo, stay there.
Let me beat you up!

61
00:05:30,181 --> 00:05:33,756
He just wanted to dry clean.

62
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,834
If you have a problem with that, everyone
Yongcheon case by Min-guk.

63
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,162
Come on, let's move.

64
00:05:39,404 --> 00:05:42,834
Then if you see someone who looks like you
montage, check his identity.

65
00:05:42,859 --> 00:05:43,497
- Understand?
- Yes.

66
00:05:43,529 --> 00:05:46,145
Chairman Jung and I will
stop by Min-guk's place.

67
00:05:46,616 --> 00:05:49,200
Who knows we might get it
good information again.

Yoon Se-eun.

70
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,905
It will all be damaged.

71
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,592
Do you want me to teach you too?

72
00:06:36,434 --> 00:06:37,956
Put the cloth together...

73
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:42,387
and in turn you insert the
needle into the fabric like this.

74
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,874
Finish with a ribbon knot.

75
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,113
Finished.

76
00:06:54,056 --> 00:06:55,756
Looks perfect
sewn like this, right?

77
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,850
Doesn't look like
separated, right?

78
00:06:59,376 --> 00:07:01,200
Be careful playing it.

79
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,647
I'll be mad if it tears again.

80
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,244
Eun-seo, come back
go to your room and study.

81
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:38,830
Yes, Dad.

82
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,759
I'll come again later.

83
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,939
Don't be lazy and practice.

84
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,986
We'll be going out on duty soon.

85
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,785
So what happened to Eun-seo?

86
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,947
You killed him?

87
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,684
<i>Don't pull your hand away
when bitten by a dog.</i>

88
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:38,729
<i>But push deeper.</i>

89
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:42,481
<i>His mouth will open
and let go of your hand.</i>

90
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,129
It is here.

91
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,004
Block 203, number 802.

92
00:08:58,164 --> 00:09:01,950
Pink blouse, 20,000 won.

CHOI MIN-GUK (YONGCHEON BANK)

94
00:09:03,011 --> 00:09:05,278
You are right. After
he's not coming anymore?

95
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:07,140
Yeah, I didn't see it.

96
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,341
When delivering clothes, are there any contents?
His rather strange phone conversation...

97
00:09:11,381 --> 00:09:15,053
or maybe come with someone
something a bit suspicious like that?

98
00:09:15,078 --> 00:09:17,281
I'm not sure either.

99
00:09:17,985 --> 00:09:21,223
It seems like he came twice
alone and not talking to others.

100
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:26,098
Large apartments are in the new city area.
Are your customers from there too?

101
00:09:29,405 --> 00:09:31,785
That's because my laundry...

102
00:09:31,842 --> 00:09:35,893
His laundry is the best here.
That's why we have so many customers.

103
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,835
It's not like that.

104
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:41,207
Hyuk-geun was very surprised when
wash your pants at your laundry.

105
00:09:41,241 --> 00:09:44,028
I see, your feet are a little comfortable.

106
00:09:46,165 --> 00:09:47,887
About this?

107
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,723
Very obvious, huh?

108
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,309
He had an accident.

109
00:10:00,795 --> 00:10:03,758
Anyway, thank you.
Have taken the time.

110
00:10:03,856 --> 00:10:05,191
It doesn't matter.

111
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,434
Just come anytime if there is a problem.

112
00:10:07,539 --> 00:10:08,541
Thank You.

113
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,094
What is that space?

116
00:10:12,478 --> 00:10:13,972
Can I see it?

117
00:10:14,517 --> 00:10:14,935
Yes?

118
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:18,140
Why did you come here?
Let's just go.

119
00:10:18,165 --> 00:10:20,754
It's okay. My place.
Open to you.

120
00:10:21,507 --> 00:10:22,567
Please take a look around.

121
00:10:36,991 --> 00:10:38,318
Base.

122
00:10:39,873 --> 00:10:40,945
Forgive me.

123
00:10:41,723 --> 00:10:43,461
It's okay, it's natural.

124
00:10:45,641 --> 00:10:46,462

WE NEED INFORMATION
PHOTO FIRST, FACE SKETCH NOW

129
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:13,515
Sorry, Min-guk.

130
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,716
If someone is at a dead end, they will
definitely so no matter what he does.

131
00:11:17,741 --> 00:11:20,280
There are times when I am also very
want to teach him a lesson.

132
00:11:21,026 --> 00:11:23,480
It's okay, he must be curious too.

133
00:11:36,121 --> 00:11:37,553
MY WIFE

134
00:11:37,974 --> 00:11:39,572
I'll take a call first.

135
00:11:39,597 --> 00:11:40,430
Yes.

136
00:11:45,516 --> 00:11:47,437
Hello, are you done?

137
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:50,882
You've tried. How are you?

138
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,560
Nothing's wrong, right?

139
00:12:35,454 --> 00:12:37,014
This place is old.

140
00:12:37,605 --> 00:12:39,360
I'm embarrassed to show it.

141
00:12:39,711 --> 00:12:41,886
I put together what I
could just to find food.

142
00:12:42,493 --> 00:12:44,991
No, thank you for your cooperation.

143
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,827
Yes, whenever you need.

144
00:13:01,579 --> 00:13:03,759
WE NEED INFORMATION
PHOTO FIRST, FACE SKETCH NOW

145
00:13:30,528 --> 00:13:32,000
What is it?

146
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:35,753
What is he doing?

147
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:49,852
We just came to ask. Why
to the point of searching his workplace?

148
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:53,133
Even though this is in the city, it's
different from in Seoul. Rumors spread quickly.

149
00:13:53,354 --> 00:13:56,192
Later you buy a drink and meet him.

150
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:59,566
Apologize and say it honestly.

151
00:13:59,784 --> 00:14:00,617
Senior Chang Jin.

152
00:14:03,047 --> 00:14:05,152
Let's try checking Choi Min-guk.

153
00:14:05,188 --> 00:14:07,477
Why is our conversation
heading in that direction?

154
00:14:07,567 --> 00:14:09,297
Besides the perpetrator
may know the victim...

155
00:14:09,391 --> 00:14:12,329
in the laundry also usually use
lax, needles, thread, etc.

156
00:14:12,648 --> 00:14:15,829
He also uses a lot of plastic items
such as buckets and brushes.

157
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,297
I don't know what to say.

158
00:14:18,553 --> 00:14:21,528
If that's your logic,
I also need to get checked.

159
00:14:21,688 --> 00:14:23,164
There are a lot of those
things in my house.

160
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:27,282
So, how about this?

161
00:14:31,288 --> 00:14:32,121
Similar, right?

162
00:14:32,493 --> 00:14:35,630
Isn't this person's way of walking normal?

163
00:14:36,733 --> 00:14:38,924
That's right.

164
00:14:40,849 --> 00:14:41,682
Geez.

165
00:14:43,029 --> 00:14:44,829
- Doctor Seo?
- Geez.

166
00:14:44,869 --> 00:14:47,008
We meet again after
you live here.

167
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:49,383
Correct.

168
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,868
Where do you want to go?

169
00:14:53,451 --> 00:14:54,329
Are you hurt?

170
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,641
I'm a little bit stumped.

171
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,804
Something is stuck.

172
00:15:01,461 --> 00:15:02,294
Blood?

173
00:15:02,671 --> 00:15:03,504
Blood?

174
00:15:05,074 --> 00:15:06,661
It is nothing.

175
00:15:08,703 --> 00:15:10,124
I thought you were hurt again.

176
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,673
Excuse me.

177
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,880
Doctor Seo.

178
00:15:14,049 --> 00:15:15,500
We have something.

179
00:15:15,925 --> 00:15:17,469
Right, I forgot.

180
00:15:18,058 --> 00:15:20,106
Regarding the report
toxicology of cases one and two.

181
00:15:20,161 --> 00:15:24,826
Lately I've been a bit overwhelmed just receive
verbal information without having the documents.

182
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,797
Can I have a copy?

183
00:15:28,739 --> 00:15:29,785
That's the thing apparently.

184
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,353
Of course.

185
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,563
When should I submit it?

186
00:15:33,941 --> 00:15:34,774
That...

187
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,075
Lately we have had to
report to the head of office.

188
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,250
Is it possible today?

189
00:15:42,619 --> 00:15:45,255
I'll try today.

190
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,955
Happy working again.

191
00:15:50,956 --> 00:15:51,789
Yes, be careful.

192
00:16:20,665 --> 00:16:23,082
PANCURONIUM BROMIDE

193
00:16:25,135 --> 00:16:26,752
PANCURONIUM CONTENT 5.6µG/ML

194
00:16:29,086 --> 00:16:30,501
NOT DETECTED

195
00:16:32,377 --> 00:16:34,443
NUMBER HIDDEN

196
00:16:44,667 --> 00:16:45,597
<i>Already home?</i>

197
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,269
What do you want?

198
00:16:47,582 --> 00:16:49,042
Dad should be the one asking that.

199
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,495
Do you really mean to kill me?

200
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,355
You have no right to talk like that.

201
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:55,754
After shocking me with electricity.

202
00:16:55,911 --> 00:16:56,869
<i>If not so...</i>

203
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:00,487
My daughter who has not been seen for a long
time I met him about to stab his father.

204
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,909
<i>Can't Dad?
Advise you as a parent?</i>

205
00:17:04,376 --> 00:17:06,698
Have you seen the montage?

206
00:17:07,062 --> 00:17:08,108
What montage?

207
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:09,245
<i>A gift from you.</i>

208
00:17:09,547 --> 00:17:11,306
Spread throughout Yongcheon.

209
00:17:11,392 --> 00:17:14,277
<i>That's it. How is it? Do you like it?</i>

210
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:18,011
In fact, Dad can do other things too.

211
00:17:18,316 --> 00:17:19,434
As you wish.

212
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,558
<i>Now I am very
trouble because of you.</i>

213
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,511
Don't be like this.

214
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,687
And we make one actor.

215
00:17:32,663 --> 00:17:35,676
This is what Doctor Seo told me, right?

216
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,280
I thought the case was closed.

217
00:17:37,343 --> 00:17:40,315
Why is it so exciting?
A drug addict?

218
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:43,217
Even though rumors have spread
if he is indeed weak, right?

219
00:17:43,422 --> 00:17:45,564
What is this? "Undetected"?

220
00:17:45,596 --> 00:17:50,097
I don't know who wrote it, but
This must be giving Doctor Seo a headache.

221
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,683
O-shaped legs.

222
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,335
Have you shared the montage?

223
00:17:54,359 --> 00:17:55,767
- Already.
- How is the result?

224
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:57,113
Still nothing.

225
00:17:57,151 --> 00:17:59,424
We have conducted a surprise inspection.

226
00:17:59,449 --> 00:18:01,347
But still haven't got anything.

227
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:04,192
You guys should
I've got a little info.

228
00:18:04,293 --> 00:18:07,502
By the way, regarding the case
The Blue Barrel I mentioned yesterday...

229
00:18:07,581 --> 00:18:10,073
Oh my, you're up to your old tricks again.

230
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,347
The word "not yet" from not yet I
have already forbidden it if it is solved.

231
00:18:12,386 --> 00:18:14,226
Yes, I know.

232
00:18:14,374 --> 00:18:16,698
But please listen to me just once.

233
00:18:16,815 --> 00:18:18,683
I think, we really
can see something.

234
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,620
The case has many
relevance to our case.

235
00:18:20,684 --> 00:18:24,206
Frankly, we all believe it if this
is not the perpetrator's first crime.

236
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:28,878
Take a look at this.

237
00:18:30,448 --> 00:18:34,275
Mutilation of 17 parts, cleaned with
lax, death due to neck fracture...

238
00:18:34,346 --> 00:18:36,142
pancuronium from an injection site.

239
00:18:36,167 --> 00:18:40,668
Then the suspect Go Doo-sam also has a child a girl
the same age as the child in yesterday's photo.

240
00:18:40,785 --> 00:18:44,514
If there is thread and medicine,
will be exactly the same as our case.

241
00:18:44,593 --> 00:18:45,994
Seok-woo, whose side are you on?

242
00:18:46,228 --> 00:18:48,073
There is no bias in the investigation.

243
00:18:48,134 --> 00:18:48,967
Because of that...

244
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:53,290
If we dig into this case while
investigating the girl in the photo...

245
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,977
we might find something...

246
00:18:55,015 --> 00:18:55,803
Okay.

247
00:18:56,943 --> 00:18:57,870
That makes sense too.

248
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,940
That makes perfect sense.

249
00:19:00,061 --> 00:19:04,104
I'll leave this part to Chairman Jung.
Completely. So, just do it as freely as you like.

250
00:19:05,422 --> 00:19:06,276
You are serious?

251
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:06,969
Yes.

252
00:19:07,974 --> 00:19:10,049
But you can't invite anyone else.

253
00:19:10,074 --> 00:19:13,391
They are already overwhelmed. It
could be a riot. if added unsolved cases.

254
00:19:13,512 --> 00:19:16,489
Because this is the result of your thinking,
you just finish it at your level...

255
00:19:16,696 --> 00:19:18,512
no matter how.

256
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:22,753
Then we must not be
discouraged. Understand?

257
00:19:22,894 --> 00:19:25,519
We have to show that
we focus on this case now...

258
00:19:25,596 --> 00:19:28,861
up to 280 thousand residents
Yongcheon can sleep soundly.

259
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:30,620
Then you, Chairman Jung.

260
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,089
As you have previously determined, bring
the results even if it's just a fingernail.

261
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,995
Oh my, damn.

262
00:19:43,449 --> 00:19:47,416
Now Chairman Jung
you've felt it, right?

263
00:19:47,718 --> 00:19:51,730
We have to focus on one investigation
in times of personnel shortages like this.

264
00:19:52,129 --> 00:19:56,494
If you move alone like this, the ones who have
the most difficulty are your team members.

265
00:20:06,077 --> 00:20:07,730
<i>Make the perpetrator?</i>

266
00:20:10,613 --> 00:20:13,573
<i>You still keep it
Oh Min-ho's corpse, right?</i>

267
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,534
Give me the body and organs.

268
00:20:17,313 --> 00:20:21,019
I will make the perpetrator with
implanting someone else's DNA.

269
00:20:21,398 --> 00:20:22,878
All these things you do...

270
00:20:24,553 --> 00:20:26,565
I can sort everything out well.

271
00:20:29,117 --> 00:20:30,433
Do you want to fix it?

272
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:34,276
<i>Why my daughter Se-eun
so changed your mind?</i>

273
00:20:35,278 --> 00:20:39,019
<i>This wouldn't have happened if you hadn't
put my photo inside the corpse.</i>

274
00:20:39,916 --> 00:20:41,823
<i>So, let's get this sorted out.</i>

275
00:20:42,505 --> 00:20:46,011
<i>We sorted everything out like it never happened.
Happened and start again with a new one.</i>

276
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,153
Okay.

277
00:20:54,423 --> 00:20:55,885
<i>I will prepare the perpetrator.</i>

278
00:20:56,018 --> 00:20:58,675
<i>There are people anyway
targeted by the police.</i>

279
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:02,737
<i>If you can get it
a little DNA from that person's house...</i>

280
00:21:02,878 --> 00:21:05,866
<i>I'll put it in
body parts and throw them away.</i>

281
00:21:05,953 --> 00:21:11,675
<i>Then you autopsy him and all
finished once the suspect is identified.</i>

282
00:21:11,953 --> 00:21:15,198
<i>This is made more exciting by the doctor
the forensics is my own daughter.</i>

283
00:21:16,488 --> 00:21:20,323
<i>Dad also prepared the car.
You just warm up your body first.</i>

Yes.

Damn it. Who are you?
